    <h1>The battle of Didgori</h1>
    <p class="first">The Battle of Didgori (Georgian: დიდგორის ბრძოლა, romanized: didgoris brdzola) 
        was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Seljuk Empire at the narrow place of Didgori,
         40 km west of Tbilisi, on August 12, 1121. The large Muslim army, under the command of Ilghazi,
          was unable to maneuver and suffered a devastating defeat due to King David IV of Georgia's effective military tactics.

        The battle at Didgori was the culmination of the entire Georgian–Seljuk wars and led to the Georgians' 
        reconquest of Tbilisi in 1122. Soon after that David moved the capital from Kutaisi to Tbilisi. 
        The victory at Didgori inaugurated the medieval Georgian Golden Age and is celebrated 
        in The Georgian Chronicles as a (Georgian: ძლევაჲ საკვირველი dzlevay sak'virveli lit. the "miraculous victory").
         Modern Georgians continue to remember the event as an annual August 12 festival known as Didgoroba ("[the day] of Didgori").[22][23]

    <p class="second">King David could not allow Ilghazi to unite with the Tbilisi Muslims,
         so he decided to intercept him on his way there. 
         He used a strategy of surprise and to entice the enemy step-by-step into a trap.
          He chose a mountainous and wooded area near the Didgori Mountain range, 
          situated between Manglisi and Tbilisi, to attack. "On August 11, 1121,
           King David led his army along the Nichbisi valley from the ancient capital
            of Mtskheta and divided his troops into two parts, 
            one under his personal command and the other smaller group under his son Demetrius I,
             hidden in reserve behind the nearby heights with orders to attack the flank at a given signal."[25]

             The numbers of Seljuks fleeing the field was reportedly so large
              that the Georgian cavalry was taking scores of prisoners for several days.
               As a result, the Georgians were able to liberate the entire region 
               from Muslim influence and even contest territories within the Seljuq Empire, 
               which at that point was left almost defenceless.
                The captured Seljuqs would serve for David's ambitions to rebuild his kingdom.[34]
